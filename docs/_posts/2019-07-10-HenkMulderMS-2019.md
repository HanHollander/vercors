---

>**[On July 10th, 2019, Henk Mulder got his Master degree at University of Twente](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/news/view/91/)**.
>
>Henk Mulder did his Master Thesis at the Formal Methods and Tools group, on identifying and solving bottlenecks in the VerCors tool, under the supervision of [Marieke Huisman](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marieke/). 
>The VerCors toolset can be used to verify memory safety and functional correctness of concurrent and parallel programs.
>By encoding the problem into an intermediate language the power of existing tools is leveraged to support additional concurrency models.
>However, for certain programs verification takes significant time. Thanks to the work of Henk Mulder, we now know why, and more importantly, what we can do about it.
